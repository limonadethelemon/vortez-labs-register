Still, mutations happened, creation of death is completely bald and its skin became an inhumane dark red, it also developed six, completely pitch dark, eyes and two horns.</p><p>Update: Creation of death is also shown to have very inhumane capabilities, even at a young age, we have recorded him breaking doors open and smashing walls with some ease, he has outrun our best subjects and can also see in the dark easily, we have predicted that by the time he reaches adulthood, he will become the perfect living war machine.</p><p>Update 2: while doing some rigorous tests, a malfunction in the facility happened, sending creation of death into panic and resulting in the lower part of his body being cut, and his fingers being detached, we have no recordings of what happened, the personnel who was visioning the tests has no memory of what happened and creation of death refuses to tell us.</p><p>▇▇▇▇ is our master, ▇▇▇▇ is our god.</p><p>Dr.▇▇▇▇▇</p></div>",
